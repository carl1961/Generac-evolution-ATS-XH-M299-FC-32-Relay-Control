Generac 200 amp automatic transfer switch Generator Power Module setup

My evolution 1 controller would not switch to generator power (ground to 23 not working) Happened after power fikering a number of time , it is a well known issue.

the PCB trace of this ground is very small and goes to via's on both ends (bad design) the price for another evolution 1 controller is $400.00, just to do it again.

Using 2 XH-M299 220/12v power modules and 2 FC-32 on/off delay modules set to delay on, I was able to minic the evolution 1 controllers logic, Utility power module set to 10 seconds and Generator Power module set to 30 seconds.
