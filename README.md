Generac 200 amp automatic transfer switch Generator Power Module setup

My evolution 1 controller would not switch to generator power (ground to 23 not working) Happened after power fikering a number of time , it is a well known issue.
The PCB trace of this ground is very small and goes to via's on both ends (bad design) the price for another evolution 1 controller is $400.00, just to do it again.
Using 2 XH-M299 220/12v power modules and 2 FC-32 on/off delay modules set to delay on, I was able to minic the evolution 1 controllers logic, Utility power module set to 10 seconds and Generator Power module set to 30 seconds.

I powered the FC-32 modues with 12v DC , Set jumper S7 and jumpers for S1 and S2 to both 0 (towards Blue relay) , take all other jumpers off. turning the 3362 potentiometer counter clock wise (almost all the way). power the FC-32 on and count time until green led come on. I wrote 10 on blue relay for the 10 seconds, and 30 for the 30 seconds. 


2 XH-M299 $12.00

Newer models , sometimes labeled FC-31 has no Jumper 7 and or only On delays
